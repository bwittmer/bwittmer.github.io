A brief overview: I refactored much of the existing code, I implemented tests for the software, I restructured the SQL-Database, and I was the developer who conceptualized and implemented the messaging system that Regalia Share employs.</p>

I am a very much hands-on learner, so the way I that I became familiar with this software was by looking at the code and refactoring it.</p>

                            <p>This page's backend was heavily refactored, to introduce more OOP principles, one of which is the principle of cohesion, where each function does one thing, and one thing only.</p>

                            <p>This page's backend was completely reworked.  Originally, the 'Cancelled' field was in another field within the Reservation entity, and I merged the tow fields, which were `Reservation_approval` and `Reservation_Status`.  This allows for cleaner query requests and allows for a streamlined experience without the extra clutter of more fields.</p>

Staring in our second iteration, I began to refactor the tests that were included to make all tests pass and preform the newer functionality. During the 3rd iteration I went through and added new tests to the existing code base, and we ended up with 160 tests. The 4th iteration was when I went through and added the remaining tests, tests for the Messaging feature, and removed all tests that were no longer needed.
